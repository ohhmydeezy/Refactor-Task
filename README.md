Installation: 

Step 1: Creating a Repo. 
    - to create a repo log into the Github account and select the option to create a repo ensuring that the "add Readme file" box is ticked. 
    - Once the repo was created cloning the repo on the terminal using "git clone "<SSH link>"
Step 2: creting the folders and files for the repo:
    to make a folder, in the terminal, use "mkdir (folder name i.e "assests"), in this file the CSS stylesheet will be housed as well as any assests such as images for the page. 
    -to make the HTML file and the CSS file use "touch <file name>.html" and the same can be done to make a CSS style sheet but using "touch <file name>.CSS. 
Step 3: Creating the code: 
    - Since task was to refactor a code that was previously completed, adding the HTML and the CSS files, was simply a case of copy and pasting the code from the University of Birmingham Repo. 

Step 4: Fixing the HTML file: 
    - begining with adding a concise title in the <head> and adding alt tags for all of the images on the page impoves both the SEO of the page and the accessibility. 
    - in additon to this creating sections for the code ensures that the code is easier to read and when making ammendments, it is easier to follow. 
Step 5: simplfying the CSS stylesheet: 
    -the initial stylesheet including duclicate code for similar elements, categorising and grouping these elements that for future changes, changing one code will make changes all elements within the same family. 


Usage: 

 - the page can be used as a marketing promotional tool. With the simplicity of the page, this can be used as a tool for presentations to both maketing professionals as well as professionals outside the field.
